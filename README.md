# Python---Instacart-Analysis

Performing initial data and exploratory analysis with **Python** to provide insights and suggest strategies to an online Grocery store **Instacart** for better segmentation based on the provided data

Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns.

# Project Summmary
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
